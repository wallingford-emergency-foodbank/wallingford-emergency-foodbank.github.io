        <h2>Referral Agencies</h2>

        <h3>Can I refer someone to Wallingford Emergency Food Bank?</h3>

        <p><b>Yes, if…</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>You are part of an organisation supporting those in need. Please find a list of existing referral agencies <a href="/assets/documents/referring_agencies.pdf">here</a>.</li>
            <li>The person you wish to help is resident in Wallingford, Benson, Berinsfield, Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, Crowmarsh, Goring, Streatley, Watlington, Woodcote or within that area.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If these apply, and your organisation is not already on our list of referring agencies, then please contact <a href="mailto:manager.wallingfordfoodbank@gmail.com">manager.wallingfordfoodbank@gmail.com</a> to be issued with authorisation numbers.</p>

        <p>Please note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not cover Cholsey: contact <a href="https://www.cholseyvolunteers.org/our-services-0">here</a>.</li>
            <li>We do not cover Ipsden: contact <a href="https://www.springwaterchurch.org.uk/testimonies/good-neighbour-food-bank/">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How do I make the referral?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><b>To refer a client please ring the food bank.</b> The telephone number is <a href="tel:01491 876677">01491 876677</a>.</li>
            <li><b>You can leave a message at any time.</b></li>
            <li>We are however only in the food bank on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays between 10 and 12. The drivers set off with the parcels from about 12.15, so clients can expect the food in the early afternoon on those days.</li>
            <li>If you prefer you can give the client the authorisation number and they can call us. We need a phone request each week, with an authorisation number, when food is required. <i>But please make the first referral yourself.</i></li>
            <li>We deliver the food parcels to most clients but if they are local, they are welcome to collect by prior arrangement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What does the phone message need to include?</h3>

        <p>Client’s name, full address and post code, telephone number, <b>authorisation number</b>, how many people we are feeding - how many adults and children, and the ages of the children. We also sometimes have nappies and baby food so do please let us know if there is a baby, its age and the appropriate nappy size.</p>

        <h3>For how long can I refer someone?</h3>

        <p>We rely on referrers to assess if the client continues to be in need. We do not have a particular number of weeks a client can be helped. The manager may contact you from time to time to confirm that you are confident that the client is still in need.</p>
