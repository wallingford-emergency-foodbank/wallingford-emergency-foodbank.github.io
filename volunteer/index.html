            At present our volunteers pack bags of food on a Monday between 10.00am and 12pm, on a Thursday morning, between 9.30am and 1pm and on a Friday morning from 10 - 12pm.  Our volunteers also receive and sort donated food on a Wednesday morning between 9.00am and 10.30am. 
        </p>

            At present volunteer drivers deliver the food parcels to clients between approximately 12pm and 2pm on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays. We pay mileage currently at 45p per mile. All timings vary a little from week to week, depending on demand.
        </p>
        <p>
            All our volunteer roles require reasonable fitness as the bags are very heavy and there is a lot of lifting and handling. We have good numbers of volunteers, so you are likely to be needed about once a month for packing and twice a month for driving.
